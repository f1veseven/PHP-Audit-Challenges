# Challenge 
```php 
class Challenge {
    const UPLOAD_DIRECTORY = './solutions/';
    private $file;
    private $whitelist;

    public function __construct($file) {
        $this->file = $file;
        $this->whitelist = range(1, 24);
    }

    public function __destruct() {
        if (in_array($this->file['name'], $this->whitelist)) {
            move_uploaded_file(
                $this->file['tmp_name'],
                self::UPLOAD_DIRECTORY . $this->file['name']
            );
        }
    }
}

$challenge = new Challenge($_FILES['solution']);
```

# Solution 
The challenge contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in line 13. The operation in_array() is used in line 12 to check if the file name is a number. However, it is type-unsafe because the third parameter is not set to 'true'. Hence, PHP will try to type-cast the file name to an integer value when comparing it to the array $whitelist (line 8). As a result it is possible to bypass the whitelist by prepending a value in the range of 1 and 24 to the file name, for example "5backdoor.php". The uploaded PHP file then leads to code execution on the web server.
