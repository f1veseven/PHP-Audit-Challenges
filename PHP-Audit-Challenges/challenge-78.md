# Challenge
```php 
class Carrot {
    const EXTERNAL_DIRECTORY = '/tmp/';
    private $id;
    private $lost = 0;
    private $bought = 0;

    public function __construct($input) {
        $this->id = rand(1, 1000);

        foreach ($input as $field => $count) {
            $this->$field = $count++;
        }
    }

    public function __destruct() {
        file_put_contents(
            self::EXTERNAL_DIRECTORY . $this->id,
            var_export(get_object_vars($this), true)
        );
    }
}

$carrot = new Carrot($_GET);
```

# Solution
This class is vulnerable to directory traversal because of mass assignment. The constructor can be used to set arbitrary class attributes (line 11). By overwriting the attribute $id you gain control over the first parameter of file_put_contents() in line 16. With the help of ../ it is possible to target arbitrary files on the system that are writable, for example it can be used to create a PHP shell in the document root. The values that are send to the class are incremented in line 11 and thus an integer after the operation is done. The incrementation happens after the assignment though, so the class attribute contains the original value of $count.
To avoid this security issue be vary careful when using reflection based on user input to set variables. It is recommended to implement a white-list verfication that contains the names of all variables that can be modified. A real world example of a vulnerability that is caused by mass assignment can be found in our blog.
