# Challenge
```php 
class RealSecureLoginManager {
    private $em;
    private $user;
    private $password;

    public function __construct($user, $password) {
        $this->em = DoctrineManager::getEntityManager();
        $this->user = $user;
        $this->password = $password;
    }

    public function isValid() {
        $pass = md5($this->password, true);
        $user = $this->sanitizeInput($this->user);

        $queryBuilder = $this->em->createQueryBuilder()
            ->select("COUNT(p)")
            ->from("User", "u")
            ->where("password = '$pass' AND user = '$user'");
        $query = $queryBuilder->getQuery();
        return boolval($query->getSingleScalarResult());
    }

    public function sanitizeInput($input) {
        return addslashes($input);
    }
}

$auth = new RealSecureLoginManager(
    $_POST['user'],
    $_POST['passwd']
);
if (!$auth->isValid()) {
    exit;
}
```

# Solution
This challenge is supposed to be a fixed version of day 13 but it introduces new vulnerabilities instead. The author tried to fix the DQL injection by applying addslashes() without substr() on the user name, and by hashing the password in line 13 using md5(). Besides the fact that md5 should not be used to hash passwords and that password hashes should not be compared this way, the second parameter is set to true. This returns the hash in binary format. The binary hash can contain ASCII characters that are interpreted by Doctrine. In this case an attacker could use the value 128 as the password, resulting in v�an���l���q��\ as hash. With the backslash at the end the single quote gets escaped leading to an injection. A possible payload could be ?user=%20OR%201=1-&passwd=128.
To avoid DQL injections always use bound parameters for dynamic conditions. Never try to secure a DQL query with addslashes() or similar functions. Additionally, the password should be stored in a secure hashing format, for example BCrypt.
