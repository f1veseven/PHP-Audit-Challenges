# Challenge 
```php 
function __autoload($className) {
    include $className;
}

$controllerName = $_GET['c'];
$data = $_GET['d'];

if (class_exists($controllerName)) {
    $controller = new $controllerName($data['t'], $data['v']);
    $controller->render();
} else {
    echo 'There is no page with this name';
}

class HomeController {
    private $template;
    private $variables;

    public function __construct($template, $variables) {
        $this->template = $template;
        $this->variables = $variables;
    }

    public function render() {
        if ($this->variables['new']) {
            echo 'controller rendering new response';
        } else {
            echo 'controller rendering old response';
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution 
In this code are two security bugs. A file inclusion vulnerability is triggered by the call of class_exists() in line 8. Here, the existance of a user supplied class name is checked. This automatically invokes the custom autoloader in line 1 in case the class name is unknown which will try to include unknown classes. An attacker can abuse this file inclusion by using a path traversal attack. The lookup for the class name ../../../../etc/passwd will leak the passwd file. The attack only works until version 5.3 of PHP.
But there is a second bug that also works in recent PHP versions. In line 9, the class name is used for a new object instantiation. The first argument of its constructor is under the attackers control as well. Arbitrary constructors of the PHP code base can be called. Even if the code itself does not contain a vulnerable constructor, PHP's built-in class SimpleXMLElement can be used for an XXE attack that also leads to the exposure of files. A real world example of this exploit can be found in our blog post.
